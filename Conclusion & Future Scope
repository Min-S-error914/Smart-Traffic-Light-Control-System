Conclusion

Implemented a simple, clear simulation of an adaptive traffic light controller in C++.

Demonstrated how green times can be allocated based on traffic densities while respecting safety bounds.

The simulation is useful for educational purposes and as a starting point for real-world integration.

Future scope (possible improvements)

Use real-time sensor input (e.g., camera counts or loop detectors).

Add pedestrian crossing signal integration and priority.

Implement emergency vehicle preemption: override to give immediate green to incoming emergency direction.

Add queue modeling (simulate vehicles arriving, queue lengths) and measure metrics like average waiting time, throughput.

Use reinforcement learning / model predictive control to optimize overall throughput rather than proportional allocation.
