High-level idea

At each cycle the controller reads traffic densities (either from sensors or from user input in this simulation).

It computes green durations for NS and EW proportionally:

green_duration = min_green + round((density / total_density) * (max_green - min_green))

Yellow and all-red times are fixed for safety.

The controller alternates green between NS and EW every cycle.

Design decisions & assumptions

Densities are positive integers representing vehicle counts or relative weights.

The system ensures a minimum green time (sufficient for pedestrian crossing / safety) and caps maximum green time to prevent starvation.

Yellow and all-red are short fixed durations for safety.
