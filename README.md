The project demonstrates how adaptive signal control can improve traffic flow and support smart city development.
# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Control System (C++)

## 📝 Project Description
The **Smart Traffic Light Control System** is a C++ program that simulates an intelligent traffic signal controller.  
It automatically adjusts green light durations based on traffic density, reducing congestion and waiting time.  
This project demonstrates how adaptive signal control can improve traffic flow and support smart city development.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design an adaptive traffic light system that adjusts timings automatically.  
- To use C++ for simulating intelligent traffic control.  
- To minimize waiting time and traffic congestion.

---

## 💻 About the Language
The project is developed using **C++**, a high-performance, object-oriented language suitable for simulations.  
It supports modular programming and efficient logic implementation, making it ideal for real-time control systems.

---

## 🧩 Technique Used
The system uses the **Adaptive Signal Control Technique**, where green light duration is decided based on vehicle density.  
Traffic density inputs are compared, and green times are allocated proportionally.

---

## 🔢 Input
- Traffic density for each direction (North–South and East–West).  
- Input can be entered manually or generated randomly.

Example:
