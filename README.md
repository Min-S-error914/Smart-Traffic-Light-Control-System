# Smart-Traffic-Light-Control-System
It is a C++ program that simulates an intelligent traffic signal controller.   It automatically adjusts green light durations based on traffic density, reducing congestion and waiting time.   The project demonstrates how adaptive signal control can improve traffic flow and support smart city development.
